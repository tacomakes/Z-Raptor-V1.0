This may not seem like I did much until you consider what makes a good 3d printer:
rididity
flexibility
uses
expanion
and ease of use
I found that by designing a corexy system, I could hit every mark easily.
the base of the printer has been established: I will be using a Corxy, Voron-style hotend, 3 separate Z-axis lead screws, MMU (or AMS), Klipper firmware, Klipper board, BIGTREETECH SKR PRO V1.2, which has 6 separate stepper drivers, for NEMA 17. And this is only the minimum. 
One of the biggest things that I wanted to hit was G34, or G-code for probing z offset separately. this is utilized with two separate Z motors, a minimum of two motors. When I can achieve this, then it will be able to do non-planar printing, which can cut down on support cost and filament cost.
